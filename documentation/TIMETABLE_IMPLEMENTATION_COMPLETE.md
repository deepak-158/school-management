## 📚 Curriculum Implementation

### Grade 10 Classes (10-A, 10-B)
**Subjects**: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, Hindi, Computer Science, Physical Education

**Sample Monday Schedule (Grade 10-A)**:
- 09:00-09:45: Mathematics (Anita Verma) - Math Room
- 09:45-10:30: English (Sunita Joshi) - English Room
- 10:45-11:30: Physics (Vikram Singh) - Physics Lab
- 11:30-12:15: Chemistry (Priya Patel) - Chemistry Lab
- 13:00-13:45: Biology (Ravi Kumar) - Biology Lab
- 13:45-14:30: Computer Science (Anita Verma) - Computer Lab

### Grade 9 Classes (9-A, 9-B)
**Subjects**: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English, Hindi, History, Geography

**Key Difference**: Grade 9 has History and Geography instead of Computer Science and PE, reflecting age-appropriate curriculum.

## 🔐 Access Control Implementation

### Role-Based Timetable Access
- **Students**: Automatically see their own class timetable (based on `students.class_id`)
- **Teachers**: Can view timetables of classes they teach + class selection dropdown
- **Principal**: Can view any class timetable + "All Classes" option in dropdown

### API Endpoints
- **GET `/api/timetable`**: Returns user's relevant timetables based on role
- **GET `/api/timetable?class_id=X`**: Returns specific class timetable (with permission checks)
