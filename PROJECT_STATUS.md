- Seeding: `npm run seed` to populate sample data
- Schema changes: Update `src/lib/database.ts`
- Environment path: Configurable via `DATABASE_PATH` in `.env.local`

### Authentication Flow
- Login → JWT token → localStorage storage
- Route protection via `ProtectedRoute` component
- Role-based UI rendering in components
- Session timeout configurable via environment
